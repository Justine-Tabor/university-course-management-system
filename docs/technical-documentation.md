* **System Components:**

  * **Frontend Layer:** User interface for students, faculty, and administrators.  
  * **Backend Layer:** API services for business logic.  
  * **Database Layer:** Stores courses, student records, grades, and faculty assignments.  
  * **Authentication Module:** User verification and session management.

### **5\. Development Guidelines**

* **Coding Standards:**

  * Use consistent naming conventions (CamelCase for functions, snake\_case for variables).  
  * Modular programming approach for maintainability.  
  * Proper error handling and logging.  
* **Version Control:**

  * Follow Git branching strategy (main, dev, feature branches).  
  * Commit messages should be descriptive and follow a defined format.  
  * Pull requests require peer review before merging.  
* **Security Best Practices:**

  * Encrypt sensitive data using industry-standard algorithms.  
  * Implement OAuth2 or JWT for authentication.  
  * Validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
